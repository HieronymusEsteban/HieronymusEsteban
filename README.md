## About me ðŸ‘‹
I have a degree in biology (M Sc) and in philosophy (history and philosophy of science) and a strong interest in data analysis and data engineering.
While the biological world is fraught with individual differences and irregularities, mathematics focuses on generalisability. Therefore, I always felt there was something neat about how mathematical concepts can be applied to biological data to gain useful insights. A particularly impressing example is the mathematical description of how neurons (nerve cells) interact with each other in networks, which has given rise to the use of artificial neural networks in machine learning and to the development of various deep learning algorithms. Neural networks and machine learning in general continue to fascinate me. 
Today, I am interested in all kinds of machine learning applications and in data analysis in general. On my GitHub page you find projects that I work on out of passion during my free time.
